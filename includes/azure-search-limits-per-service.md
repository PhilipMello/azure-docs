Search service limits for storage, partitions, and replicas vary by service creation date, with higher limits for newer services in supported regions. Limits vary by service creation date:

+ [Before April 3, 2024](#before-april-3-2024)
+ [Between April and May 2024 (Basic, S1, S2, S3, S3 HD)](#after-april-3-2024)
+ [After May 17, 2024 (L1 and L2)](#after-may-17-2024)

A search service is subject to a maximum storage limit (partition size multiplied by the number of partitions) or by a hard limit on the [maximum number of indexes](../articles/search/search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#index-limits) or [indexers](../articles/search/search-limits-quotas-capacity.md#indexer-limits), whichever comes first. 

Service level agreements (SLAs) apply to billable services having two or more replicas for query workloads, or three or more replicas for query and indexing workloads. The number of partitions isn't an SLA consideration. For more information, see [Reliability in Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-reliability#high-availability).

Free services don't have fixed partitions or replicas and they share resources with other subscribers.

### Before April 3, 2024

| Resource | Free | Basic | S1 | S2 | S3 | S3&nbsp;HD | L1 | L2 |
|----------|-------|------|----|----|----|----------- |----|----|
| Service level agreement (SLA)| No |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |
| Storage (partition size) | 50&nbsp;MB |2&nbsp;GB |25&nbsp;GB |100&nbsp;GB |200&nbsp;GB |200&nbsp;GB| 1&nbsp;TB | 2&nbsp;TB  |
| Partitions | N/A |1 |12 |12 |12 |3 |12 |12 |
| Replicas | N/A |3 |12 |12 |12 |12 |12 |12 |

### After April 3, 2024

+ Basic tier supports three partitions and three replicas, for a total of nine search units (SU). It also has larger partitions.
+ S1, S2, S3, and S3 HD have larger partitions, ranging from 3-7 times more, depending on the tier.
+ Higher capacity is limited to [new search services](/azure/search/search-create-service-portal) in [supported regions](#supported-regions-with-higher-storage-limits). There is no in-place upgrade at this time.

| Resource | Free | Basic  | S1 | S2 | S3 | S3&nbsp;HD | L1 | L2 |
|----------|------|--------|----|----|----|------------|----|----|
| Service level agreement (SLA) | No |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |

| Partitions | N/A |3 |12 |12 |12 |3 |12 |12 |
| Replicas | N/A | 3 |12 |12 |12 |12 |12 |12 |

### After May 17, 2024

+ L1 and L2 have more partition storage and compute power.
+ Higher capacity is limited to [new search services](/azure/search/search-create-service-portal) in [supported regions](#supported-regions-with-higher-storage-limits). There is no in-place upgrade at this time.
