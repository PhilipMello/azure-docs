>[!NOTE] 
>On March 31, 2025, support for instrumentation key ingestion will end. Instrumentation key ingestion will continue to work, but we'll no longer provide updates or support for the feature. [Transition to connection strings](/azure/azure-monitor/app/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings) to take advantage of [new capabilities](/azure/azure-monitor/app/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings#new-capabilities).
